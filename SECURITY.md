## Vulnerability Reporting

We provide a clear process for reporting security vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** create an issue on GitHub.
Instead, please email us at [telegram @eMailManBot](https://t.me/eMailManBot).
We will acknowledge your report, conduct an investigation, and work on a resolution.
